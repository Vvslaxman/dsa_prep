# ‚úÖ **Day 1: Graph Basics, BFS, DFS, and Shortest Path Algorithms**

## **1. Introduction to Graphs**

### ‚û§ **Basic Terminology**

* **Graph**: A collection of **nodes (vertices)** and **edges (connections)** between them.
* **Directed Graph**: Edges have direction (A ‚ûù B).
* **Undirected Graph**: Edges go both ways (A ‚Äî B).
* **Weighted Graph**: Edges have weights/costs.
* **Unweighted Graph**: All edges are considered equal in weight (often used in BFS).

### ‚û§ **Graph Representations**

#### üü¢ **Adjacency List**

* A list where each index represents a node and stores its neighbors.
* **Space Efficient**: O(V + E)
* **Example**:

  ```python
  graph = {
      0: [1, 2],
      1: [0, 3],
      2: [0],
      3: [1]
  }
  ```

#### üîµ **Adjacency Matrix**

* A 2D matrix where matrix\[i]\[j] = 1 (or weight) if there's an edge from i to j.
* **Space Complexity**: O(V¬≤)
* **Faster edge checks**, but consumes more space.



## **2. Graph Traversals**

### ‚û§ **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

* Uses a **queue**.
* Traverses **level-by-level**.
* Used for:

  * Finding **shortest path in unweighted graphs**
  * **Bipartite check**
  * **Connected components** in undirected graphs

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    visited.add(start)
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        print(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
```


### ‚û§ **Depth-First Search (DFS)**

* Uses **recursion** or **stack**.
* Explores **as far as possible** along one branch before backtracking.
* Used for:

  * **Cycle detection**
  * **Topological sort**
  * **Connected components**

```python
def dfs(graph, node, visited):
    visited.add(node)
    print(node)
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)
```



## **3. Shortest Path Algorithms**

### ‚û§ **Dijkstra's Algorithm**

* **Greedy approach**.
* For **weighted graphs** with **non-negative weights**.
* Uses a **priority queue (min-heap)**.

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    min_heap = [(0, start)]
    
    while min_heap:
        dist, node = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        for neighbor, weight in graph[node]:
            new_dist = dist + weight
            if new_dist < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = new_dist
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (new_dist, neighbor))
    return distances
```


### ‚û§ **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**

* Handles **negative weights**.
* Detects **negative weight cycles**.
* Time complexity: O(VE)

```python
def bellman_ford(edges, V, source):
    dist = [float('inf')] * V
    dist[source] = 0

    for _ in range(V - 1):
        for u, v, w in edges:
            if dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
                dist[v] = dist[u] + w

    # Check for negative cycle
    for u, v, w in edges:
        if dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
            return "Negative Cycle Detected"
    return dist
```


### ‚û§ **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**

* All-pairs shortest path.
* Works with negative weights (no negative cycles).
* Time complexity: O(V¬≥)

```python
def floyd_warshall(matrix):
    V = len(matrix)
    for k in range(V):
        for i in range(V):
            for j in range(V):
                matrix[i][j] = min(matrix[i][j], matrix[i][k] + matrix[k][j])
```

### ‚û§ **Prim‚Äôs Algorithm**

* Start from any node.
* Use a **min-heap** to pick the smallest edge.
* Time: O(E log V) with priority queue.

```python
import heapq

def prim(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    min_heap = [(0, start)]
    total_cost = 0
    
    while min_heap:
        cost, node = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            total_cost += cost
            for neighbor, weight in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    heapq.heappush(min_heap, (weight, neighbor))
    return total_cost
```



### ‚û§ **Kruskal‚Äôs Algorithm**

    parent = list(range(V))

    def find(x):
        if parent[x] != x:
            parent[x] = find(parent[x])
        return parent[x]

    def union(x, y):
        parent[find(x)] = find(y)

    edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])
    mst_cost = 0

    for u, v, w in edges:
        if find(u) != find(v):
            union(u, v)
            mst_cost += w
    return mst_cost
```



## **2. Topological Sort (DAGs Only)**

### ‚û§ **DFS-Based Approach**

* Perform DFS and push nodes to a stack after visiting all neighbors.

```python
def topo_sort_dfs(graph):
    visited = set()
    stack = []

    def dfs(node):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor)
        stack.append(node)

    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            dfs(node)
    return stack[::-1]
```


### ‚û§ **Kahn‚Äôs Algorithm (BFS-based)**

* Use in-degree array to track entry count of nodes.

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def kahn_topological_sort(V, edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    in_degree = [0] * V

    # Build the graph and compute in-degrees
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        in_degree[v] += 1

    # Queue for all vertices with in-degree 0
    queue = deque([i for i in range(V) if in_degree[i] == 0])
    topo_order = []

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        topo_order.append(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)

    if len(topo_order) != V:
        return "Cycle detected - No Topological Ordering exists"
    
    return topo_order
```


## **3. Cycle Detection**

### ‚û§ **Undirected Graph (DFS)**

```python
def detect_cycle_undirected(graph, node, visited, parent):
    visited.add(node)
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            if detect_cycle_undirected(graph, neighbor, visited, node):
                return True
        elif neighbor != parent:
            return True
    return False
```

### ‚û§ **Directed Graph (DFS + Recursion Stack)**

```python
def detect_cycle_directed(graph):
    visited = set()
    rec_stack = set()

    def dfs(node):
        visited.add(node)
        rec_stack.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited and dfs(neighbor):
                return True
            elif neighbor in rec_stack:
                return True
        rec_stack.remove(node)
        return False

    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            if dfs(node):
                return True
    return False
```
